## GRSF counterfactual generation

# Gabin Vrillault

##Â Project description

This project was developed as part of my second-year engineering internship at DSV Stockholm University. It aims to generate counterfactuals for the GRSF model, which is a model that uses a forest of shapelets to classify time series data. My implementation focuses on generating counterfactuals using gradient based methods. 

## Algorithm explanation

The goal of the algorithm is to generate counterfactuals for a given time series dataset. The classifier that we want to explain is the GRSF model and it is not gradient based. Therefore, we use a surrogate model that we train on the outputs of the GRSF model on a given dataset. The surrogate model is now a gradient based model that imitates the behavior of the GRSF model. We then use this surrogate model to generate counterfactuals. For this we need a base and a target instance from different classes.
Then we use the following algorithm to generate counterfactuals:

## Repository structure
- `ui/`: Contains the Streamlit application to visualize and interact with the counterfactual generation process.
- `models.py`: Contains several classifier architectures to be used as surrogate models.
- `gen.py`: Contains the implementation of the counterfactual generation algorithm.
- `counterfactual.py`: Contains some implementation of `gen.py` to generate counterfactuals in batch and get some statistics on them.


## Try it out
There is two ways to try out the project:
1. **Locally**: 
   - Clone the repository.
   - Create a virtual environment `python -m venv .venv`.
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
      - On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Run the Streamlit app from the root of the project: `streamlit run ui/main.py`
2. **Docker**:
   - Run `docker compose up --build` from the root of the project.
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## What's next?
### Short-term goals
- [X] Add local counterfactual generation
- [X] Fix the bug with the number of counterfactuals generated
- [ ] Add support for different loss functions (custom ?)
- [ ] Finish custom surrogate model implementation in the streamlit app (safely)
- [ ] Add support to save every parameters and results of the counterfactual generation process
- [ ] Save and preload trained models in the Streamlit app
- [X] Add training logs visualization
      -> Note to self: I should build a new module for this that would be unified across the project.
      and then I could use it to save the experiment logs / load them in the Streamlit app.

### Long-term goals
- [ ] Add more surrogate model architectures
- [ ] Implement additional counterfactual generation methods
- [ ] Add support for multivariate time series
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
