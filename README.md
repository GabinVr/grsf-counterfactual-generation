## GRSF counterfactual generation

# Gabin Vrillault

##Â Project description

This project was developed as part of my second-year engineering internship at DSV Stockholm University. It aims to generate counterfactuals for the GRSF model, which is a model that uses a forest of shapelets to classify time series data. My implementation focuses on generating counterfactuals using gradient based methods. 

## Algorithm explanation

The goal of the algorithm is to generate counterfactuals for a given time series dataset. The classifier that we want to explain is the GRSF model and it is not gradient based. Therefore, we use a surrogate model that we train on the outputs of the GRSF model on a given dataset. The surrogate model is now a gradient based model that imitates the behavior of the GRSF model. We then use this surrogate model to generate counterfactuals. For this we need a base and a target instance from different classes.
Then we use the following algorithm to generate counterfactuals:
