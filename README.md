## GRSF counterfactual generation

# Gabin Vrillault

## Project description
This project was developed as part of my second-year engineering internship at DSV Stockholm University. It aims to generate counterfactuals for the GRSF model, which is a model that uses a forest of shapelets to classify time series data. My implementation focuses on generating counterfactuals using gradient based methods.
